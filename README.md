# ESP8266 Wardriving
A compilation of scripts and resources for wardriving on the [ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266), including data visualization tools in Jupyter Notebook.

Documentation on this page is still in development.

## Components
Any ESP8266-based board should work with the basic required components, but the D1 mini form factor is highly recommended since using modules (such as for SD logging + battery management) can be done using plug-and-play hardware in a small footprint. All linked components are D1 mini compatible. 

**Required Components:**
| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| ESP8266 | Gather WiFi data & control hardware modules
| SD Reader | Store data that we can analyze with WiGLE / Python |
| GPS Module | Grab geolocation data + timestamp |

**Optional Components:**
| Component | Purpose | 
| --- | --- |
| 128x64 OLED | Get a visual display of WiFi data being captured |
| LiPo Battery | Power your ESP8266 for portable applications |
| Battery Module | Manage power for your ESP8266 w/ a LiPo battery |
| 100K Î© Resistor | Optional to read in battery level w/ the D1 Mini |

## Code Breakdownn 

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The Arduino sketch written for an ESP8266-based device. It involves using various libraries to perform tasks such as displaying information on an SSD1306 OLED screen, connecting to Wi-Fi networks, reading GPS data using TinyGPS++, and logging network information to an SD card.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Library inclusions:
   - `Adafruit_SSD1306.h`: Library for controlling the SSD1306 OLED display.
   - `ESP8266WiFi.h`: Library for connecting to Wi-Fi networks using the ESP8266 module.
   - `SD.h`: Library for interacting with SD cards.
   - `SoftwareSerial.h`: Library for software-based serial communication.
   - `TinyGPS++.h`: Library for parsing NMEA data from GPS modules.
   - `TimeLib.h`: Library for time-related functions.

2. Definitions and global variables:
   - `UTC_offset`: The offset in hours from UTC time to the local time zone (in this case, PDT, which is UTC-7).
   - `SD_CS`: The pin number for the chip select line of the SD card module.
   - `logFileName`: The name of the log file to be created on the SD card.
   - `networks`: A counter variable to keep track of the number of Wi-Fi networks found.
   - `LOG_RATE`: The time interval (in milliseconds) for logging network information.
   - `currentTime`: A character array used to store the current time.

3. Setup function:
   - Initializes the serial communication for debugging purposes.
   - Sets up the SSD1306 display.
   - Configures Wi-Fi in station mode and disconnects any previous connections.
   - Initializes the SD card and checks if it is present. If not found, it halts the execution.
   - Initializes the software serial communication with the GPS module.
   - Waits for the GPS module to provide a valid fix.
   - Displays the GPS coordinates on the OLED screen.
   - Clears the display.

4. `lookForNetworks` function:
   - Updates the current time on the OLED display.
   - Draws lines to separate the time display from the network information.
   - Scans for available Wi-Fi networks.
   - If networks are found, it loops through each network, updates the OLED display, and logs the BSSID and SSID of the network to the SD card.
